### How to Play!

* At the start of the game there will be a *random* target number displayed.
* Your objective is to match that number!
* Each Street Fighter will be assigned a *random* value.
* This value will be hidden, when you click on one of the fighters your score will go up based on the value of the fighter!
* If you can match the random number, you win! but..... if you go over the number, you lose!
* **Good Luck!**
